abstract = "We present work aimed at developing a general framework for mesh adaption in strongly nonlinear, possibly dynamic, problems. We begin by showing that the solutions of the incremental boundary value problem for a wide class of materials, including nonlinear elastic materials, compressible Newtonian fluids and viscoplastic solids, obey a minimum principle, provided that the constitutive updates are formulated appropriately. This minimum principle can be taken as a basis for asymptotic error estimation. In particular, we chose to monitor the error of a lower-order projection of the finite element solution. The optimal mesh size distribution then follows from a posteriori error indicators which are purely local, i.e. can be computed element-by-element. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the computational framework with the aid of convergence studies and selected examples of application. "

abstract = "An adaptive meshing method tailored to problems of strain localization is given. The adaption strategy consists of equi-distributing the variation of the velocity field over the elements of the mesh. A heuristic justification for the use of variations as indicators is advanced, and possible connections with interpolation error bounds are discussed. Meshes are constructed by Delaunay triangulation. It is shown how the Hu-Washizu principle determines a consistent transfer operator for the state variables. Examples of application are given which demonstrate the versatility of the method. "
