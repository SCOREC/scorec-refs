abstract = "We present work aimed at developing a general framework for mesh adaption in strongly nonlinear, possibly dynamic, problems. We begin by showing that the solutions of the incremental boundary value problem for a wide class of materials, including nonlinear elastic materials, compressible Newtonian fluids and viscoplastic solids, obey a minimum principle, provided that the constitutive updates are formulated appropriately. This minimum principle can be taken as a basis for asymptotic error estimation. In particular, we chose to monitor the error of a lower-order projection of the finite element solution. The optimal mesh size distribution then follows from a posteriori error indicators which are purely local, i.e. can be computed element-by-element. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the computational framework with the aid of convergence studies and selected examples of application. "

The adaption strategy consists of equi-distributing the variation of the velocity field over the elements of the mesh. A heuristic justification for the use of variations as indicators is advanced, and possible connections with interpolation error bounds are discussed. Meshes are constructed by Delaunay triangulation. It is shown how the Hu-Washizu principle determines a consistent transfer operator for the state variables. Examples of application are given which demonstrate the versatility of the method. "

abstract = {The quest for more accurate numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations has motivated the study of high-order piecewise-polynomial basis functions, also known as k-version finite element methods, as a means to attain this accuracy in the most cost effective manner. Stabilized finite element methods (e.g. streamline upwind Petrov Galerkin) have been proven to attain optimal rates of convergence for any polynomial order basis as well as perform well on a variety of flows including turbulence applications. We present a stabilized finite element formulation for fluid dynamics using mesh-entity based hierarchical basis functions. The implementation is shown to attain theoretical convergence results for the linear model problem as well as the Navier-Stokes equations. &copy; 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
